## LIBRARY MANAGEMENT


The project was designed to simplify and digitalize the process of managing library resources, ensuring smooth access for both administrators and users. 
Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single project. 
It has a very user friendly interface which can easily be operated by any non-technical person.

There are essentially two modules of this software;

â€¢ Admin module: Admin will have complete control over the system. Admin has permissions to update, delete or modify any existing record or make a new entry (books and members).

â€¢ Users: The normal users enjoy only limited privileges. They have a view access to the books. They can browse through the categories, search for a particular book, return and issue a book. 
They are also provided with an email option in case of a query.
